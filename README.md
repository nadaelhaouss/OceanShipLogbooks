# OceanShipLogbooks

This project allows the user to visualize the OceanShipLogbooks dataset in a map with an interactive panel.


## Features

* Trips of ships between 1750 to 1854 (GeoJSON)
* Daily progression of these trips under points (GeoJSON)

## Installation

Pip install the files or download it directly from this Github page. 

```
pip install git+https://github.com/nadaelhaouss/OceanShipLogbooks
```
Launch the index.html file.

## Usage/Examples

This map allow you to visualize all ship trips of the Ocean Ship Logbook dataset. You can then click on a specific path to see the daily progression of a boat with the wind direction information. Each trip in characterized by specific information : the ship's name, the commandant's name, the departure and arrival position, a trip ID and other informations of the dataset.
<br />You can also filter the data in order to access more specific information. 
<br />For example, you can search the precise trip of a precise ship in a specific year.
<br />You can download all the data or a portion of it andx you can contact us if needed.
